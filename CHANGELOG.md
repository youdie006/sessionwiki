# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning once it reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `aider` adapter (11th tool): indexes Aider sessions from per-repo
  `.aider.chat.history.md`. Markdown-derived (roles reconstructed from line
  prefixes, no per-message timestamps); edited files come from aider's
  `Applied edit to` / `Creating empty file` lines. Discovery is a bounded,
  capped, symlink-safe walk (home by default, `SESSIONWIKI_AIDER_ROOTS` to
  scope) that opens only `.aider.chat.history.md` and logs nothing.
- Recall loop (Claude Code plugin): a SessionStart hook auto-injects a small,
  fenced "prior work in this project" brief at the start of a new session, so the
  agent gets long-term memory without being asked. Exact-project scoped,
  `--no-sync` (tens of ms), zero output on fresh projects, always exits 0. The
  injected recall is fenced as untrusted data and sanitized; the LLM synopsis is
  not auto-injected. New internal `sessionwiki hook session-start` command.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `blame <file> [-L start,end]`: git blame for the AI era - attributes each line
  to the AI session most likely behind the commit that last changed it, by
  joining `git blame --line-porcelain` with the index's per-file touch records
  and session time windows. Best-effort by design (`ambiguous`/`unattributed`
  are normal) and it falls back to file-level `trace` whenever git can't carry
  the weight. The git child runs with a hardened environment (no system config,
  no pager, `core.fsmonitor`/hooks neutralized, inherited `GIT_*` cleared), the
  path is passed after `--`, and `-L` is validated. `--json` for agents.

### Security
- `truncate()` - the choke point that renders session titles to the terminal in
  `list`/`search`/`trace`/`resume` - now strips C0/C1/DEL control characters, not
  just newlines and tabs. A session title is untrusted input (a planted session
  can set any title), so an unstripped ESC could have injected ANSI/terminal
  escape sequences into output. The web UI was already safe (it builds the DOM
  with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **gptme adapter** (10th tool): indexes sessions from [gptme](https://github.com/gptme/gptme)
  (`~/.local/share/gptme/logs/<session>/conversation.jsonl`). Drops `pinned: true`
  system-prompt boilerplate and bare `system` role lines; handles Python's naive
  `datetime.now().isoformat()` timestamps (no UTC offset) by falling back to
  UTC-assumed parsing. Size-capped against `MAX_SESSION_FILE_BYTES`.
- Windows install: `scripts/install.ps1`, a PowerShell one-liner (`irm ... | iex`)
  that downloads + checksum-verifies the latest Windows binary and adds it to
  PATH. The shell installer already covers WSL, which is Linux.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-18

### Security
Hardening from a red-team pass of the launch surface (all confirmed with PoCs):
- The local web server now rejects requests whose `Host` header isn't the
  loopback name it bound (defeats DNS rebinding) and whose `Origin` is a
  different site (defeats a plain cross-origin `fetch`), so a malicious page you
  visit while `web` is running can't read your sessions from `127.0.0.1`.
- `resume` no longer auto-launches Codex or Gemini in a directory the session
  file claims. Those tools aren't directory-scoped, so a planted session could
  name any directory (with an attacker's `AGENTS.md` there) and have `resume`
  load it; it now prints the command for you to run unless the directory is
  verified, which only Claude Code's store layout allows.
- `resolve` escapes `LIKE` wildcards in a session-id prefix, so a web request for
  id `%` can no longer match and dump an arbitrary session.
- install.sh documents honestly that its checksum only detects a corrupted
  download, not a malicious release (the hash is co-located with the binary).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `digest [--since 7d]`: a markdown rollup of recent sessions grouped by project
  &mdash; what you worked on, the files each session touched, and any cached
  synopsis. It composes the timeline, provenance, and summaries the index already
  has, over a time window (`--since 2w`/`24h`/`90m`, `--project`, `--tool`,
  `--json`). The standup / PR-description / "what did I ship this week" view.

### Security
- `resume` no longer auto-launches the upstream tool (`claude`/`codex`) in the
  directory a session file *claims* unless that directory can be verified as the
  session's own &mdash; for Claude Code, by matching the store folder the session
  lives in (the folder name encodes the cwd). A session file is untrusted input;
  before this, a planted or prompt-poisoned session could point its `cwd` at an
  attacker directory and have `resume` launch the agent there, loading that
  directory's `CLAUDE.md` / `.mcp.json` / settings. When the directory can't be
  verified, `resume` now prints the command for you to run instead of launching.
- Session-file reads are size-capped (256 MB) and the OpenCode SQLite message/
  part reads are `LIMIT`ed, so a malicious oversized file or a db packing
  millions of rows into one session can't exhaust memory.

### Changed
- `SECURITY.md` now documents that `migrate` writes copies into the target tool's
  store and that `resume` validates the session-derived directory, instead of
  implying the tool only ever reads.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `migrate <id> <dir>`: copy a session so it can be resumed from a different
  project directory. Each tool ties a session to a directory differently, so
  migrate does the right thing per tool: Claude Code's resume is scoped to the
  project folder, so the transcript is copied into the target's folder; Codex
  resumes by id from any directory, so nothing is copied (it just prints the
  command); Gemini copies the chat into the target project's store
  (`~/.gemini/tmp/<sha256(dir)>/chats/`) and rewrites its `projectHash`. The
  original session is never modified.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `recall <query>`: one-shot recall — searches, lists the candidate matches, and
  briefs the top one, collapsing the usual search -> pick id -> brief loop into a
  single command (`--tool`/`--project`/`-n`/`--max-chars`/`--json`/`--no-sync`).
- `sync [--tool]`: build or refresh the index on demand, so later queries can run
  with `--no-sync`.
- `--no-sync` on `search`/`list`/`recall`/`show`/`brief`/`resume`/`trace`: query
  the already-built index without walking the stores — the fast path when the
  index is kept warm (e.g. a cron running `sessionwiki sync`).

### Changed
- `show`/`brief`/`resume`/`recall` resolve the id against the existing index first
  and only sync (all tools) when it is genuinely unknown (no prefix match) - an
  already-indexed id, including an *ambiguous* prefix, no longer triggers a full
  walk of every store (notably the large Codex one). The tradeoff: a session that
  has grown since the last sync is served at its last-synced length until the next
  `sync`.
- Harness labeling (the oh-my-* tags from 0.9.0) is now detected from the
  filesystem only - the `.omc`/`.omo` orchestration directory in a session's
  project - dropping the transcript-text markers. Those markers were the tools'
  own source/doc literals, so a session that merely *discusses* a harness (e.g.
  while building OSS) was mislabeled as run by it; the filesystem signal cannot
  be confused that way. oh-my-codex leaves no directory and is no longer tagged.
- A tag filter (`list --tag`, web) now includes subagent transcripts, and `list`
  marks them `[subagent]`, so a tag carried only by a subagent is no longer shown
  in the tag cloud yet hidden from the listing.

### Fixed
- `recall --json` includes the plain `snippet` next to `snippet_marked` in each
  candidate, matching `search --json`; `recall`'s candidate list marks subagent
  transcripts `[subagent]`.
- `sync` reports the count of top-level live sessions (matching `stats`/`list`)
  instead of every file row, which had included subagent transcripts.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Five new adapters, bringing supported tools to nine: the **Cline family**
  (Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code) from one parser over their shared VS Code
  `globalStorage/<ext>/tasks/<id>/` layout - handling both native `tool_use`
  blocks and the XML-in-text tool calls Cline writes, and pulling edited files
  from either; **gajae-code** (and upstream Pi) from `~/.gjc/agent/sessions`
  JSONL; and **Continue** from `~/.continue/sessions/*.json`. Each extracts the
  files a session edited so they show up in `trace`.
- Harness labeling for the Korean "oh-my-*" wrappers. oh-my-claudecode,
  oh-my-codex, and the oh-my-openagent / lazyclaudecode / lazycodex family run
  on top of Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode, so their conversations are already
  indexed via those adapters; sessionwiki now detects which harness drove a
  session (from the markers each injects) and auto-tags it `oh-my-claudecode` /
  `oh-my-codex` / `oh-my-openagent`, so `list --tag oh-my-claudecode` works. No
  new adapter required.

### Changed
- The OpenCode adapter now reads OpenCode's SQLite store
  (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, plus `opencode-<channel>.db` and
  `OPENCODE_DB`), which has been the default since OpenCode v1.2.0 - the
  previous JSON-only reader missed every session created on a current install.
  The legacy `storage/**` JSON layout is still read on pre-1.2.0 installs. This
  needed a small shared-store path in the indexer (one SQLite db holds many
  sessions, so the file-per-session + mtime model did not fit); `scan` sizes the
  db and re-indexes only sessions whose updated-time changed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- OpenCode adapter: indexes sst/opencode sessions from
  `~/.local/share/opencode/storage` (the multi-file session/message/part JSON
  layout, joined in id order), including the files each session edited (the
  `edit`/`write` tools' `filePath` and `patch` file lists) for `trace`. Brings
  supported tools to four.
- Provenance: sessions are linked to the files they edited or created, read
  from their tool calls (Claude's `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`, Codex's
  `apply_patch`). New commands: `files <id>` (a session's edits) and
  `trace <path>` (the sessions that touched a file, newest first, matched by
  suffix so a relative path resolves to the absolute one on disk). The scope is
  honest — sessions that *touched* a file, not line-level authorship.
- `related` now also links sessions that edited the same file, even across
  projects; `stats` reports the count of files linked to a session.
- Web UI: a session's touched files appear as chips in its header; clicking one
  lists every session that touched it (new `/api/trace` endpoint).
- Archive mode: when a tool deletes a session's original file, sessionwiki
  keeps the indexed copy instead of dropping it, so `search`, `trace`, and
  `brief` keep working for it. A durable `archive` table survives schema
  rebuilds; archived sessions are served from the index (`show`/`brief`/web),
  flagged `[archived]` in `list`/`show`/web, and counted in `stats`. `sync`
  reports how many were kept. New `forget <id>` purges a session for good;
  re-appearing files un-archive automatically; `SESSIONWIKI_NO_ARCHIVE` reverts
  to delete-on-prune. A store that vanishes wholesale (uninstall, unmount) is
  not mass-archived.
- Korean/CJK search: 2-syllable words (회사, 검색) - the most common Korean word
  length - are now searchable via a LIKE fallback below the trigram floor, and
  all indexed text + queries are NFC-normalized so macOS NFD input no longer
  silently returns nothing. "Zero-setup CJK search" is now actually true.
- `--json` on `search`, `list`, `related`, `brief`, `trace`, and `files`: stable
  snake_case output (matching the web API) for agent consumption, with the
  absolute path hidden. Snippets are control-code-free with a `snippet_marked`
  variant. The agent-native half of the tool.
- Claude Code plugin (`/plugin marketplace add youdie006/sessionwiki`): a
  `session-recall` skill + `/sessionwiki:recall` command that use the `--json`
  commands so an agent recalls past sessions as long-term memory, fully offline,
  degrading gracefully when the CLI isn't installed.

### Changed
- `show` pages long transcripts through your pager (`SESSIONWIKI_PAGER`, then
  `PAGER`, default `less -FRX`) when stdout is a terminal, so `show --full` of a
  huge session no longer floods the screen, and falls back to plain printing when
  no pager is installed; piped/redirected output is unchanged.
- `summarize` states up front that it pipes each transcript to the summarizer
  (the default `claude -p` sends them to the Anthropic API) - the one place data
  can leave the machine, and only on explicit `summarize`.
- CLI demo is a clean static full-frame terminal (no camera zoom). The web demo
  zooms to exact element regions measured from the live DOM, at 50fps with
  cubic ease-in-out moves and still holds.

### Fixed
- `tag` now rejects a tag containing a comma or an empty tag: a comma corrupted
  the comma-joined `tags` array in `--json` and the web API, and an empty tag
  emitted `""`. JSON serialization of session rows in `search`/`trace` can no
  longer panic mid-array.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Renamed the project from `sessiondex` to **sessionwiki**, reframed around
  "session engineering": a session is a unit of context, and once you have
  hundreds they need curating, not just searching. The data directory migrates
  newest-name-first (`sessiondex` then `session-atlas`), carrying the index and
  curated tags/notes/summaries over.

### Added
- Curation layer (the editable "wiki" part): `tag` / `note`, stored in the
  index and surviving reindexing; the original session files are never touched.
- `related`: sessions about the same thing — same project first, then anything
  sharing a tag — surfaced in `show` and as a "see also" panel in the web UI.
- `projects` and `stats`: per-project and per-tool/per-month rollups.
- Web UI: clickable tag chips and a tag-filter bar, notes, a "see also" panel,
  a node-graph logo, and a globe-button language picker.
- Two demo GIFs: a narrated CLI recording (`docs/demo-cli.gif`) and a web UI
  tour (`docs/demo-web.gif`). `SECURITY.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Library + binary split (`src/lib.rs`): the adapter and index logic is now a
  reusable crate, not just a CLI.
- Golden-file parser tests for all three adapters, covering boilerplate
  dropping, subagent detection, schema variants, multi-block content, and
  malformed-line tolerance (`tests/parse.rs`, `tests/fixtures/`).
- GitHub Actions: CI (fmt + clippy + test) and a release workflow that builds
  prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS (x86_64 + arm64), and Windows on tag push.
- `scripts/install.sh` one-line installer that fetches the right prebuilt
  binary for the platform.
- A "how this differs from a single-tool viewer" section in the README.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Renamed the project from `session-atlas` to **sessiondex**. The data
  directory migrates automatically on first run, carrying the existing index
  and cached summaries over.

### Added
- Multilingual web UI (English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese), auto-detected from
  the browser locale and switchable from the sidebar.
- Korean README (`README.ko.md`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `summarize`: cache 1–2 sentence LLM synopses using your own LLM CLI. Stored
  in a table that survives index schema rebuilds.
- README polish: logo, light/dark adaptive hero, architecture diagram, FAQ.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Session previews (last assistant message) in the web sidebar.
- `show --outline`: a deterministic digest of a session (every user turn plus
  how it ended), and a clickable outline in the web transcript.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `resume`: reopen a session in its original tool (`claude --resume` /
  `codex resume`) in the right project directory.
- `brief`: emit a markdown briefing of a session to carry context across tools.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Initial release: `scan`, `list`, `search`, `show`, and a local web UI over an
  incremental SQLite FTS5 index. Adapters for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini
  CLI. 100% local, no telemetry.
