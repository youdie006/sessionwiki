# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning once it reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`Codex::in_home` and `ClaudeCode::in_home` for embedders with several
  installs of one tool.** A program that drives more than one Codex or Claude
  Code install (`~/.codex2`, `~/.claude4`, and so on) can now build one adapter
  per install root; the adapter knows its own session sub-directory layout, so
  the caller passes only the home. Every install keeps the shared tool name, so
  parsing by tool name still works for rows from any of them. An adapter built
  this way scopes deletion reconciliation to its own root, so syncing one
  install never archives another install's rows. `Codex::default()` and
  `ClaudeCode::default()` keep reading the stock locations as before.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Embedders can index custom adapters with `index::sync_with`, restrict deletion
  reconciliation to their own keys with `Adapter::reconcile_scope`, and render
  a redacted briefing without its source path with `commands::brief_markdown`.
  Custom tool names are preserved when reading sessions from the index.

### Fixed

- Sessions indexed by an external adapter stay readable in `show`, `brief`, MCP
  and the web viewer while their source files still exist. Readers without the
  adapter use the indexed transcript instead of failing with `unknown tool`;
  the embedder must sync again to publish later changes. Built-in adapters still
  reparse live files and report parse errors. The web viewer now shares the same
  reader as the CLI and MCP.
- Redirected synchronization logs omit terminal-only progress redraws while
  retaining warnings and per-tool summaries.

### Maintenance

- CI and the dependency auto-merge gate use `actions/setup-python` v7 with
  the existing Python 3.12 configuration.

Implementation and validation: [PR #26](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/pull/26)
and [PR #27](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/pull/27). Publication and
installation verification are recorded in the
[0.29.0 release](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/releases/tag/v0.29.0).

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Large MCP turn responses remain valid JSON.** Quote-heavy and backslash-heavy
  text can expand when JSON-encoded, exceeding the transport cap even when its
  raw character count fits. Single-turn responses now retain the longest text
  prefix that fits after serialization and set `clipped: true`, preserving the
  schema, turn identity and original retained byte count. If metadata alone
  exceeds the limit, window and turn responses return a small, parseable JSON
  error instead of a success payload cut in the middle of a string.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **Exported session fields are redacted before they are shortened.** Briefs,
  summarizer input and MCP session windows now redact the complete parsed
  session, including titles, project names, paths, messages and edit snippets,
  before rendering or applying length limits. This covers reparsed originals
  and archived sessions, including single-turn MCP output. A token cut by a
  preview or output budget can no longer survive as an unrecognized prefix.
- **Prompt-derived titles and previews no longer preserve credential fragments.**
  Redaction runs before adapters select a title line or shorten tool previews,
  edit snippets and Prodex answers, including structured tool input and
  multiline private keys.
- **Turning off swapdex serving clears subsequent account badges.**
  `serve-off` is an explicit attribution boundary until a later `use`,
  `restore` or `serve` event activates an account. It no longer leaves the
  previous account attached to later sessions.
- **Incomplete discovery no longer looks like deleted sessions.** Aider walk
  errors and unreadable, malformed or partial Prodex registry/task listings
  retain the incomplete-discovery signal, so synchronization preserves live
  sessions until a complete listing can reconcile deletions.

### Maintenance

- Update `dirs` from 6 to 7. Its upstream behavior change affects Windows
  `preference_dir()`, which sessionwiki does not call; the home, configuration
  and data directory functions used for session discovery remain unchanged.
  The update was checked against the current implementation with 205 Rust
  tests and clippy passing.
- Dependency auto-merge now verifies the workflow, repository, PR and tested
  commit, checks permitted manifest and lockfile changes structurally, and
  rechecks current state before merging. Incomplete or inconsistent evidence
  refuses the merge. The gate's regression tests run in CI.

Implementation and review: [a1ef3a8](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/commit/a1ef3a884cacecb1b495fff5710709318de8ffc0)
and [PR #21](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/pull/21). Publication and
installation verification are recorded in the
[0.27.0 release](https://github.com/youdie006/sessionwiki/releases/tag/v0.27.0).

## [0.26.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **A brief no longer carries credentials off the machine.** `redact` has
  stripped them since the beginning, at INDEX time, because the index outlives
  the original session. `brief_text` does not read the index: `load_session`
  parses the ORIGINAL file whenever it still exists and falls back to the index
  only when it is gone, so the same session was redacted only in the case where
  the original had been deleted. Every consumer sends the text somewhere -
  `brief` is written to be pasted into another session and says so, `recall`
  prints it for the same, `summarize` pipes it to an external LLM CLI, and the
  MCP server hands it to a connected agent. That MCP handler already neutralized
  the title, redacted the username out of the project path, stripped control
  characters and framed the whole thing as untrusted data; credentials were not
  on the list. Stripped now in `brief_text`, where all four meet, and before the
  length budget - a truncated secret is still a leaked prefix.
- **The timeline read is bounded for real.** `load_events` said it capped the
  read as defence against a hand-edited file, then read the whole thing into
  memory and capped only the PARSE. It takes the last megabyte as whole lines
  now, dropping the one the seek cut in half so no fragment can parse as a
  different record.
- **A partial store walk says it skipped deletion reconciliation.** Two paths
  carry that rule - do not archive off an incomplete listing - and only one said
  so. The silent one is the path aider takes, and aider is rootless: its walk
  covers the whole home under a two-second budget, and the flag is set on any
  cap-hit. On a large home reconciliation could be skipped every run with
  nothing saying why a session the tool deleted was still listed.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **The account badge names the account that actually served the session.** It
  counted swapdex's `use` and `restore` events, which was right while every
  switch went through them. Switching now goes through swapdex's proxy, which
  writes `serve` - and `serve` was being dropped as "not a switch". True of the
  event, false of the question: on a machine driven by the proxy it is the only
  record of which account was live. Every claude-code session on this one was
  badged with nothing while 190 serve events named three accounts, and codex
  sessions carried a `use` from six weeks before the account last changed. The
  newest event now wins whatever kind it is; a session that predates every event
  still gets no badge rather than a guess. The parsing half is separated from
  the file read so which lines survive it is testable.
- **The prodex adapter's four reads are bounded.** The memory cap on session
  files exists so a corrupt or hostile one cannot exhaust the process. Eleven
  adapters went through it; prodex read its task JSON, its result JSON, its
  registry and its artifact with a plain `fs::read` - one of them under a comment
  saying "Bounded read; an artifact is normally a few KB", where the largest file
  in the real store on this machine is 35 MB.
- **`doctor` no longer reports a failed count as zero.** The count of sessions
  kept after their tool deleted them turned any error - a schema without
  `archived_at`, a locked database - into "0 kept", which reads as the good news
  that nothing was lost.
- **A redirected run leaves the real index alone.** The one-time migration from
  the old directory names looked under `dirs::data_dir()` whatever `SESSIONWIKI_DATA`
  said, then renamed what it found into the destination - so a redirected run
  could move the user's real index out of their home.
- `ResumeInfo`'s doc claimed every supported tool encodes its native session id
  in the filename. Two of twelve do, and the code already answers None for the
  rest; only the comment was wrong.

### Added

- `doctor` says when a store's location could not be worked out, instead of
  giving that the same silence as a tool that is not installed. Defence, not a
  reproduced failure - on Unix `dirs` falls back to the passwd database, so
  unsetting HOME does not make it fire.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **A renamed folder no longer hides a file's history.** `trace` matched paths by
  suffix, so a file traced by the path it has TODAY found nothing once its folder
  had been renamed - and said "no session touched a file matching ...", about a
  file whose entire history was in the index under the old directory. Found on a
  real machine where `~/Project/lunch` had become `~/Project/slack`: the sessions
  that built it were all there and unreachable by the path the owner had. A full
  path that matches nothing now retries with the file NAME, which is the part
  that survives a move, and says so - otherwise the older paths listed underneath
  read as the index pointing somewhere wrong.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- **`migrate --config-dir`** - write a transcript into a specific account's
  store instead of always the default one. This is what lets a conversation be
  handed to another ACCOUNT: under swapdex's slot model each account has its own
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` with its own `projects/` inside, and migrate wrote into
  `~/.claude` unconditionally, so on a slotted machine the copy succeeded and
  landed where the resuming account never looks. Without the flag
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is honoured, so running inside a slot's own shell already
  does the right thing; failing both, the single default store.

- **`doctor`** - a read-only, one-command health check of this machine's setup:
  which session stores exist (and how many sessions each holds), the index's
  schema currency and core-table presence, how many sessions are indexed (and
  kept after a tool deleted them), and the version. `--json` for scripts. When
  something looks empty or stale the cause is usually mundane; this surfaces it
  so a bug report starts from facts.
- **Secrets are redacted from message text, titles, edit snippets, and synopses
  at index time** (`[redacted:<kind>]`) - PEM private keys, JWTs, and prefixed
  tokens (OpenAI, AWS, GitHub, Stripe, Google, Slack). The index outlives the
  original session via archive mode, so credentials must not land in it. A
  schema bump scrubs sessions already indexed before this change. Dependency-free
  and tuned to high-confidence shapes to avoid redacting ordinary code.
- **File history - "how this file was written".** Clicking a file in the web UI
  now shows its evidence chain: the sessions that edited it, newest first, each
  with what it actually changed - the edit kind (edit/write/multiedit) and a
  bounded snippet of the new code, not just a bare list of sessions that touched
  the path. This answers *why does this file look like this*. Backed by a new
  `edits(session_id, path, kind, ts, snippet)` cache table (extracted at parse
  time from each tool call, rebuilt on a schema bump like the other cache
  tables), an `evidence_for(path)` assembly, and a `GET /api/file?path=`
  endpoint. `trace`/`blame` still give the path-level provenance.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-20

Open any live session by its native id (codex-rollout or claude-transcript
UUID), closing the harness tower to sessionwiki join gap.

### Added

- `session_window`/`show` now resolve a session by its native codex-rollout or
  claude-transcript UUID (full or prefix), in addition to the sessionwiki short
  id. Live sessions not yet indexed are found via a disk-scan fallback (no
  sync), so a session started today opens by native id in one call.
- `list`, `recent_sessions`, and `search` JSON now expose a `native_id` field
  (the UUID only, never the absolute path). Closes the harness tower to
  sessionwiki join gap.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-16

Harden the MCP read path for in-loop agent-to-agent reads: a stable window
contract and freshness on every read tool.

### Added
- **`session_window` (MCP) now returns versioned JSON** (schema `sessionwiki.window/1`) instead of an unversioned text render, so a reading agent can parse a sibling's window rather than scrape it. Fields: `id`, `tool`, `project`, `title`, `started`/`ended`, `messages` (total turns), `large` (indexed head+tail), `budget_tokens`, `omitted_leading`, `turns[]` (each with `i` = stable turn index, `role` = user/assistant/tool, `text`, and `truncated` or `folded`+`bytes`), and a `drilldown` hint. Deterministic for a fixed (id, budget); the recent tail is kept within budget and the whole object is size-guarded so it is always valid JSON. Tool output is folded head+tail and byte-bounded.
- **Per-turn drill-down:** `session_window(id, turn=<i>)` returns that one turn's full retained text (schema `sessionwiki.turn/1`), untruncated by the window's folding/cap - fetch-full-content-on-demand for a turn seen in a window. (Tool outputs are already capped at parse time, so this recovers folded-out lines, not adapter-dropped bulk.)

### Changed
- **`search_sessions` (MCP) freshens in the background**, matching `recent_sessions` (0.20.2): it serves the current index immediately and kicks a bounded incremental sync, so a just-created sibling shows on a subsequent search without the request ever waiting on the store walk. `session_window` already reads the target file directly (live). This closes the last MCP read tool that did no freshen; incremental parsing (only files whose mtime/size changed) was already in place.

## [0.20.2] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- **`recent_sessions` (MCP) freshens in the background.** It returns the current index immediately (~200ms) and kicks a bounded incremental sync, so a just-started sibling session shows on the next call - without the multi-second blocking sync a full 46GB-corpus walk would cost. New `index::sync_bounded` re-parses only files modified since a floor and never archives a live session on a bounded run.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Over-cap sessions are windowed (head+tail) instead of dropped.** A session past the 256MB read cap was skipped entirely - so the biggest sessions, the ones most worth referencing across sessions, vanished from search and `session_window`. They are now indexed from the first 256KB + last 512KB of lines (byte-bounded, no full scan), partially readable, and flagged `[large]` in the title.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-15

Cross-session context for agents: one agent can now see what a sibling session
(or its other self) is doing, as the ACTUAL recent conversation - not a lossy
summary - bounded so it can't flood the reader's context.

### Added
- **`sessionwiki show <id> --window [--budget N]`** renders a session's real
  recent turns with tool outputs folded to head+tail, capped to the recent tail
  by a token budget, an orientation header + role labels, and a
  `show <id> --full` drill-down hint. `--live` reads the session file directly
  (0-delay), bypassing the index sync.
- **MCP discovery + read tools** so an agent can find and read sibling sessions:
  - `session_window(id, budget_tokens)` - the bounded window above, over stdio.
  - `recent_sessions(limit, tool, exclude_id)` - the most recent sessions across
    every tool ("who's around"), bounded to a recent window.
  - `related_sessions(id, limit, exclude_id)` - a session's siblings by shared
    project, edited files, or tags.
  Both discovery tools take `exclude_id` to drop your own session. This closes
  the chain: `recent`/`search`/`related` -> id -> `session_window`. Verified
  cross-tool (Claude Code and Codex sessions see each other).

### Fixed
- (from 0.19.4) `sessionwiki web` no longer auto-opens a browser on WSL, where
  `xdg-open` pops a stray WSLg/Windows window on every start and often can't
  reach the loopback server; it prints the URL instead. Native Linux/macOS keep
  auto-open.

## [0.19.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **`sessionwiki web` no longer pops a stray browser window on WSL.** On WSL,
  `xdg-open` launches a WSLg/Windows browser on every `web` start - a blank
  window each time you restart the server during development, and it often
  cannot even reach the loopback address. `web` now detects WSL and prints the
  URL instead of auto-opening; native Linux/macOS keep the existing auto-open
  (still overridable with `--no-open`).

## [0.19.3] - 2026-07-14

Codex/Claude transcript formats drifted; a comprehensive audit against the
real corpus caught five parsing gaps, all fixed here.

### Fixed
- **Codex user messages no longer index twice.** Current rollouts carry each
  prompt BOTH as an `event_msg` and as a `response_item`; the adapter now
  cancels each pair exactly once (counted, so a genuinely repeated prompt -
  "continue" twice - still keeps every occurrence).
- **AGENTS.md instructions no longer become session titles.** The new
  `# AGENTS.md instructions for <path>` / `<INSTRUCTIONS>` user-message shape
  is treated as boilerplate, like the older environment-context wrappers.
- **2025-era Codex rollouts parse again.** Files that predate the `payload`
  envelope (bare `{"type":"message"}` lines) indexed as empty "(no user
  prompt)" sessions; they are now parsed like their modern counterparts.
- **`custom_tool_call` items are indexed** and their inputs feed `trace` /
  `blame` path extraction, so edits made through custom tools are no longer
  invisible.
- **Claude titles use the `ai-title` event.** Current Claude Code transcripts
  stopped emitting `summary` events; titles now fall back summary ->
  ai-title -> first user message instead of always the first prompt.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- A crafted/corrupt prodex task id with a multibyte character at a slice
  boundary could panic the parser - and a parse panic aborts the WHOLE
  indexer, so one bad `.bridge` file bricked every `list`/`search`/`scan`.
  The id timestamp parse now gates on ASCII digits before slicing (found by
  an adversarial audit; same bug class swapdex fixed a release earlier).
- `list --account` no longer silently returns fewer rows than `-n`: the
  badge filter is computed post-query, so the query now over-fetches and
  truncates after filtering.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-07

Ecosystem-walkthrough fixes, from a fresh user's chair.

### Added
- `--account <name>` on `list` and `search`: filter by the swapdex @badge,
  which the help text now explains.
- prodex consult titles are the QUESTION (prompt first line) instead of
  prodex's identical auto-title, so a list of consults is tellable apart.
  The derived-cache version was bumped, so existing rows re-index once.

### Fixed
- A consult whose answer artifact was written but whose result JSON was not
  (the crash path the durable ledger exists for) is indexed again: the
  artifact is read independently of the result.
- `trace` with an ABSOLUTE editor path now finds sessions whose stored paths
  are repo-relative (prodex bundles relative paths; matching honors the `/`
  boundary, so suffix lookalikes cannot match).
- `--tool` help enumerates prodex and points at `scan` for the full list;
  the scan footer pluralizes correctly; scan's prodex PATH shows the store
  directory (not the registry file); the prodex resume error message no
  longer has a hanging indent.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- prodex adapter: every ChatGPT Pro consult made through
  [prodex](https://github.com/youdie006/prodex) becomes a searchable session -
  the bridge task is the question, the result/answer artifact is the answer,
  and files bundled with a task become `trace` provenance links. Discovery
  reads the machine-wide bridge registry prodex >=0.11.0 maintains
  (`~/.local/share/prodex/bridges.json`); registered repos that no longer
  exist are skipped silently. `resume` on a prodex session prints the ChatGPT
  thread URL it ran in (only an `https://chatgpt.com/` URL is ever surfaced).
- Session ids for prodex are the same short stable 12-hex shape as every
  other tool (task ids share a long date prefix that would defeat prefix
  addressing).

### Changed
- `list`/`search` truncate the ID column display at 13 chars so an unusually
  long id cannot shear the table (ids are prefix-addressable).

## [0.18.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- `trace` and `related` rows now carry the swapdex `account` field like
  `list`/`search` do (the annotate call was missing on those two query paths,
  so the same session showed a badge in search but never in a file trace -
  across CLI, web, and MCP).

### Changed
- Timeline reads are capped to the newest 4000 lines (defense in depth;
  swapdex itself bounds the file to ~1000 events), and account names are
  control-char-stripped at the source so every consumer gets a terminal-safe
  badge. `search` no longer prints a trailing space on badge-less lines.
- The web UI shows the account badge in each session's meta line.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- swapdex integration: `list` and `search` badge each session with the
  account profile active when it ran (`@work`), and `--json` rows carry an
  `account` field (null when unknown). Attribution reads swapdex's switch
  timeline read-only and never guesses - sessions that predate the first
  recorded switch stay unbadged. No swapdex on the machine, no change.
  The MCP server neutralizes the new field like every other free-text one.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- `sessionwiki mcp`: a stdio MCP server exposing three read-only tools
  (`search_sessions`, `trace_file`, `get_session_brief`) to any MCP client
  (Claude Code, Cursor, and others). Cross-tool session search as agent tools;
  100% local, read-only, no sync. Register with
  `claude mcp add sessionwiki -- sessionwiki mcp`.
- Homebrew: `brew install youdie006/tap/sessionwiki` (macOS and Linux).

### Changed
- aider re-indexing is now linear instead of O(runs^2): a long
  `.aider.chat.history.md` is split once per sync and cached, so a file with
  thousands of runs re-indexes in a fraction of the time (measured 1600 runs:
  ~11s to ~0.2s).

### Fixed
- A partial directory walk (an unreadable project directory) can no longer
  archive live sessions: file-per-session adapters now report a partial listing
  and sync skips deletion reconciliation for that run, the same guard shared
  stores already had.
- `sync` warns when a session fails to parse and reports honest counts
  ("indexed 12/14 (2 failed to parse)") instead of silently dropping it.
- Tags are NFC-normalized on add, filter, and remove, so a tag typed in
  decomposed form (macOS IME) matches everywhere, like every other indexed
  string.
- `resume` checks tool support before file existence, so tools without headless
  resume (aider, OpenCode) get the right message instead of a false "the
  session file is gone".
- `digest --since` with an out-of-range duration returns an error instead of
  panicking.
- A failed data-directory migration now warns with instructions instead of
  silently starting an empty index.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- crates.io README: the dark-mode banner now uses an absolute image URL so it
  renders on the crates.io page, which (unlike GitHub) does not rewrite relative
  `<source srcset>` paths. Docs only; no code change.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- `aider` adapter (11th tool): indexes Aider sessions from per-repo
  `.aider.chat.history.md`. Markdown-derived (roles reconstructed from line
  prefixes, no per-message timestamps); edited files come from aider's
  `Applied edit to` / `Creating empty file` lines. Discovery is a bounded,
  capped, symlink-safe walk (home by default, `SESSIONWIKI_AIDER_ROOTS` to
  scope) that opens only `.aider.chat.history.md` and logs nothing.
- Recall loop (Claude Code plugin): a SessionStart hook auto-injects a small,
  fenced "prior work in this project" brief at the start of a new session, so the
  agent gets long-term memory without being asked. Exact-project scoped,
  `--no-sync` (tens of ms), zero output on fresh projects, always exits 0. The
  injected recall is fenced as untrusted data and sanitized; the LLM synopsis is
  not auto-injected. New internal `sessionwiki hook session-start` command.

### Changed
- Schema stability on the road to 1.0: the durable index tables (summaries,
  tags, notes, archive) now version independently of the disposable cache via a
  `meta.durable_version` and a forward-only, additive-only migration runner, so
  user curation and archived sessions survive every upgrade. All index
  connections now set a `busy_timeout`. No behavior change in this release (zero
  migrations registered).

### Security
- `search` strips control bytes (ESC/OSC/C1/DEL) from terminal snippets, so an
  untrusted session body can no longer inject terminal escape sequences into the
  operator's terminal. The `--json` output and other commands already did this.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `blame <file> [-L start,end]`: git blame for the AI era - attributes each line
  to the AI session most likely behind the commit that last changed it, by
  joining `git blame --line-porcelain` with the index's per-file touch records
  and session time windows. Best-effort by design (`ambiguous`/`unattributed`
  are normal) and it falls back to file-level `trace` whenever git can't carry
  the weight. The git child runs with a hardened environment (no system config,
  no pager, `core.fsmonitor`/hooks neutralized, inherited `GIT_*` cleared), the
  path is passed after `--`, and `-L` is validated. `--json` for agents.

### Security
- `truncate()` - the choke point that renders session titles to the terminal in
  `list`/`search`/`trace`/`resume` - now strips C0/C1/DEL control characters, not
  just newlines and tabs. A session title is untrusted input (a planted session
  can set any title), so an unstripped ESC could have injected ANSI/terminal
  escape sequences into output. The web UI was already safe (it builds the DOM
  with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **gptme adapter** (10th tool): indexes sessions from [gptme](https://github.com/gptme/gptme)
  (`~/.local/share/gptme/logs/<session>/conversation.jsonl`). Drops `pinned: true`
  system-prompt boilerplate and bare `system` role lines; handles Python's naive
  `datetime.now().isoformat()` timestamps (no UTC offset) by falling back to
  UTC-assumed parsing. Size-capped against `MAX_SESSION_FILE_BYTES`.
- Windows install: `scripts/install.ps1`, a PowerShell one-liner (`irm ... | iex`)
  that downloads + checksum-verifies the latest Windows binary and adds it to
  PATH. The shell installer already covers WSL, which is Linux.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-18

### Security
Hardening from a red-team pass of the launch surface (all confirmed with PoCs):
- The local web server now rejects requests whose `Host` header isn't the
  loopback name it bound (defeats DNS rebinding) and whose `Origin` is a
  different site (defeats a plain cross-origin `fetch`), so a malicious page you
  visit while `web` is running can't read your sessions from `127.0.0.1`.
- `resume` no longer auto-launches Codex or Gemini in a directory the session
  file claims. Those tools aren't directory-scoped, so a planted session could
  name any directory (with an attacker's `AGENTS.md` there) and have `resume`
  load it; it now prints the command for you to run unless the directory is
  verified, which only Claude Code's store layout allows.
- `resolve` escapes `LIKE` wildcards in a session-id prefix, so a web request for
  id `%` can no longer match and dump an arbitrary session.
- install.sh documents honestly that its checksum only detects a corrupted
  download, not a malicious release (the hash is co-located with the binary).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `digest [--since 7d]`: a markdown rollup of recent sessions grouped by project
  &mdash; what you worked on, the files each session touched, and any cached
  synopsis. It composes the timeline, provenance, and summaries the index already
  has, over a time window (`--since 2w`/`24h`/`90m`, `--project`, `--tool`,
  `--json`). The standup / PR-description / "what did I ship this week" view.

### Security
- `resume` no longer auto-launches the upstream tool (`claude`/`codex`) in the
  directory a session file *claims* unless that directory can be verified as the
  session's own &mdash; for Claude Code, by matching the store folder the session
  lives in (the folder name encodes the cwd). A session file is untrusted input;
  before this, a planted or prompt-poisoned session could point its `cwd` at an
  attacker directory and have `resume` launch the agent there, loading that
  directory's `CLAUDE.md` / `.mcp.json` / settings. When the directory can't be
  verified, `resume` now prints the command for you to run instead of launching.
- Session-file reads are size-capped (256 MB) and the OpenCode SQLite message/
  part reads are `LIMIT`ed, so a malicious oversized file or a db packing
  millions of rows into one session can't exhaust memory.

### Changed
- `SECURITY.md` now documents that `migrate` writes copies into the target tool's
  store and that `resume` validates the session-derived directory, instead of
  implying the tool only ever reads.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- `migrate <id> <dir>`: copy a session so it can be resumed from a different
  project directory. Each tool ties a session to a directory differently, so
  migrate does the right thing per tool: Claude Code's resume is scoped to the
  project folder, so the transcript is copied into the target's folder; Codex
  resumes by id from any directory, so nothing is copied (it just prints the
  command); Gemini copies the chat into the target project's store
  (`~/.gemini/tmp/<sha256(dir)>/chats/`) and rewrites its `projectHash`. The
  original session is never modified.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `recall <query>`: one-shot recall — searches, lists the candidate matches, and
  briefs the top one, collapsing the usual search -> pick id -> brief loop into a
  single command (`--tool`/`--project`/`-n`/`--max-chars`/`--json`/`--no-sync`).
- `sync [--tool]`: build or refresh the index on demand, so later queries can run
  with `--no-sync`.
- `--no-sync` on `search`/`list`/`recall`/`show`/`brief`/`resume`/`trace`: query
  the already-built index without walking the stores — the fast path when the
  index is kept warm (e.g. a cron running `sessionwiki sync`).

### Changed
- `show`/`brief`/`resume`/`recall` resolve the id against the existing index first
  and only sync (all tools) when it is genuinely unknown (no prefix match) - an
  already-indexed id, including an *ambiguous* prefix, no longer triggers a full
  walk of every store (notably the large Codex one). The tradeoff: a session that
  has grown since the last sync is served at its last-synced length until the next
  `sync`.
- Harness labeling (the oh-my-* tags from 0.9.0) is now detected from the
  filesystem only - the `.omc`/`.omo` orchestration directory in a session's
  project - dropping the transcript-text markers. Those markers were the tools'
  own source/doc literals, so a session that merely *discusses* a harness (e.g.
  while building OSS) was mislabeled as run by it; the filesystem signal cannot
  be confused that way. oh-my-codex leaves no directory and is no longer tagged.
- A tag filter (`list --tag`, web) now includes subagent transcripts, and `list`
  marks them `[subagent]`, so a tag carried only by a subagent is no longer shown
  in the tag cloud yet hidden from the listing.

### Fixed
- `recall --json` includes the plain `snippet` next to `snippet_marked` in each
  candidate, matching `search --json`; `recall`'s candidate list marks subagent
  transcripts `[subagent]`.
- `sync` reports the count of top-level live sessions (matching `stats`/`list`)
  instead of every file row, which had included subagent transcripts.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- Five new adapters, bringing supported tools to nine: the **Cline family**
  (Cline, Roo Code, Kilo Code) from one parser over their shared VS Code
  `globalStorage/<ext>/tasks/<id>/` layout - handling both native `tool_use`
  blocks and the XML-in-text tool calls Cline writes, and pulling edited files
  from either; **gajae-code** (and upstream Pi) from `~/.gjc/agent/sessions`
  JSONL; and **Continue** from `~/.continue/sessions/*.json`. Each extracts the
  files a session edited so they show up in `trace`.
- Harness labeling for the Korean "oh-my-*" wrappers. oh-my-claudecode,
  oh-my-codex, and the oh-my-openagent / lazyclaudecode / lazycodex family run
  on top of Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode, so their conversations are already
  indexed via those adapters; sessionwiki now detects which harness drove a
  session (from the markers each injects) and auto-tags it `oh-my-claudecode` /
  `oh-my-codex` / `oh-my-openagent`, so `list --tag oh-my-claudecode` works. No
  new adapter required.

### Changed
- The OpenCode adapter now reads OpenCode's SQLite store
  (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, plus `opencode-<channel>.db` and
  `OPENCODE_DB`), which has been the default since OpenCode v1.2.0 - the
  previous JSON-only reader missed every session created on a current install.
  The legacy `storage/**` JSON layout is still read on pre-1.2.0 installs. This
  needed a small shared-store path in the indexer (one SQLite db holds many
  sessions, so the file-per-session + mtime model did not fit); `scan` sizes the
  db and re-indexes only sessions whose updated-time changed.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- OpenCode adapter: indexes sst/opencode sessions from
  `~/.local/share/opencode/storage` (the multi-file session/message/part JSON
  layout, joined in id order), including the files each session edited (the
  `edit`/`write` tools' `filePath` and `patch` file lists) for `trace`. Brings
  supported tools to four.
- Provenance: sessions are linked to the files they edited or created, read
  from their tool calls (Claude's `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`, Codex's
  `apply_patch`). New commands: `files <id>` (a session's edits) and
  `trace <path>` (the sessions that touched a file, newest first, matched by
  suffix so a relative path resolves to the absolute one on disk). The scope is
  honest — sessions that *touched* a file, not line-level authorship.
- `related` now also links sessions that edited the same file, even across
  projects; `stats` reports the count of files linked to a session.
- Web UI: a session's touched files appear as chips in its header; clicking one
  lists every session that touched it (new `/api/trace` endpoint).
- Archive mode: when a tool deletes a session's original file, sessionwiki
  keeps the indexed copy instead of dropping it, so `search`, `trace`, and
  `brief` keep working for it. A durable `archive` table survives schema
  rebuilds; archived sessions are served from the index (`show`/`brief`/web),
  flagged `[archived]` in `list`/`show`/web, and counted in `stats`. `sync`
  reports how many were kept. New `forget <id>` purges a session for good;
  re-appearing files un-archive automatically; `SESSIONWIKI_NO_ARCHIVE` reverts
  to delete-on-prune. A store that vanishes wholesale (uninstall, unmount) is
  not mass-archived.
- Korean/CJK search: 2-syllable words (회사, 검색) - the most common Korean word
  length - are now searchable via a LIKE fallback below the trigram floor, and
  all indexed text + queries are NFC-normalized so macOS NFD input no longer
  silently returns nothing. "Zero-setup CJK search" is now actually true.
- `--json` on `search`, `list`, `related`, `brief`, `trace`, and `files`: stable
  snake_case output (matching the web API) for agent consumption, with the
  absolute path hidden. Snippets are control-code-free with a `snippet_marked`
  variant. The agent-native half of the tool.
- Claude Code plugin (`/plugin marketplace add youdie006/sessionwiki`): a
  `session-recall` skill + `/sessionwiki:recall` command that use the `--json`
  commands so an agent recalls past sessions as long-term memory, fully offline,
  degrading gracefully when the CLI isn't installed.

### Changed
- `show` pages long transcripts through your pager (`SESSIONWIKI_PAGER`, then
  `PAGER`, default `less -FRX`) when stdout is a terminal, so `show --full` of a
  huge session no longer floods the screen, and falls back to plain printing when
  no pager is installed; piped/redirected output is unchanged.
- `summarize` states up front that it pipes each transcript to the summarizer
  (the default `claude -p` sends them to the Anthropic API) - the one place data
  can leave the machine, and only on explicit `summarize`.
- CLI demo is a clean static full-frame terminal (no camera zoom). The web demo
  zooms to exact element regions measured from the live DOM, at 50fps with
  cubic ease-in-out moves and still holds.

### Fixed
- `tag` now rejects a tag containing a comma or an empty tag: a comma corrupted
  the comma-joined `tags` array in `--json` and the web API, and an empty tag
  emitted `""`. JSON serialization of session rows in `search`/`trace` can no
  longer panic mid-array.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Renamed the project from `sessiondex` to **sessionwiki**, reframed around
  "session engineering": a session is a unit of context, and once you have
  hundreds they need curating, not just searching. The data directory migrates
  newest-name-first (`sessiondex` then `session-atlas`), carrying the index and
  curated tags/notes/summaries over.

### Added
- Curation layer (the editable "wiki" part): `tag` / `note`, stored in the
  index and surviving reindexing; the original session files are never touched.
- `related`: sessions about the same thing — same project first, then anything
  sharing a tag — surfaced in `show` and as a "see also" panel in the web UI.
- `projects` and `stats`: per-project and per-tool/per-month rollups.
- Web UI: clickable tag chips and a tag-filter bar, notes, a "see also" panel,
  a node-graph logo, and a globe-button language picker.
- Two demo GIFs: a narrated CLI recording (`docs/demo-cli.gif`) and a web UI
  tour (`docs/demo-web.gif`). `SECURITY.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- Library + binary split (`src/lib.rs`): the adapter and index logic is now a
  reusable crate, not just a CLI.
- Golden-file parser tests for all three adapters, covering boilerplate
  dropping, subagent detection, schema variants, multi-block content, and
  malformed-line tolerance (`tests/parse.rs`, `tests/fixtures/`).
- GitHub Actions: CI (fmt + clippy + test) and a release workflow that builds
  prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS (x86_64 + arm64), and Windows on tag push.
- `scripts/install.sh` one-line installer that fetches the right prebuilt
  binary for the platform.
- A "how this differs from a single-tool viewer" section in the README.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Renamed the project from `session-atlas` to **sessiondex**. The data
  directory migrates automatically on first run, carrying the existing index
  and cached summaries over.

### Added
- Multilingual web UI (English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese), auto-detected from
  the browser locale and switchable from the sidebar.
- Korean README (`README.ko.md`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `summarize`: cache 1–2 sentence LLM synopses using your own LLM CLI. Stored
  in a table that survives index schema rebuilds.
- README polish: logo, light/dark adaptive hero, architecture diagram, FAQ.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Session previews (last assistant message) in the web sidebar.
- `show --outline`: a deterministic digest of a session (every user turn plus
  how it ended), and a clickable outline in the web transcript.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `resume`: reopen a session in its original tool (`claude --resume` /
  `codex resume`) in the right project directory.
- `brief`: emit a markdown briefing of a session to carry context across tools.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Initial release: `scan`, `list`, `search`, `show`, and a local web UI over an
  incremental SQLite FTS5 index. Adapters for Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini
  CLI. 100% local, no telemetry.
